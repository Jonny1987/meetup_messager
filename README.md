# meetup_messager

A script to automatically message users on meetup.com who are on the groups that you specify. Useful if creating a group and want to quickly invite members from similar groups.

It messages 10 users at a time and then waits a minute, since this seems to be the limit that meetup.com has imposed on messaging.

Currently not working due to meetup.com users page being changed from pages to a single page autoload.
